# Go On Daily

A streamlined personal training client management platform designed to keep trainers connected with clients between sessions.

## About Go On Daily

Go On Daily solves the accountability gap between personal training sessions. Most clients only see their trainers 1-3 times per week, but fitness success happens in the hours and days between those sessions. This app enables personal trainers to maintain consistent communication with clients, track their progress, and provide timely guidance without overwhelming administrative work.

## Core Features

- **Daily Check-ins**: Automated check-in prompts for clients to report on workouts, nutrition, and wellness metrics
- **Trainer Dashboard**: Quick overview of all client activity and alerts for clients who need attention
- **Progress Tracking**: Simple visualization of client metrics over time
- **Two-way Messaging**: Direct communication between trainers and clients
